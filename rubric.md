# Project Rubric

## Functionality
- no major errors in program functionality
- deployed to heroku
- aside from user auth, has no create update and delete functionality which is something you guys should get practice with
- functionality meets expectations for course

## User Interface
- intuitive, i was comfortable navigating through the site. I like that you have a "filter" for the locations
- visually appealing, though the banner and the text choice seems counter intuitive o.0
- css looks great, i like the shadowing for the images and the rounded edges, nice touch. I think if you added a background color it would make it pop more, maybe lightblue!? i dunno i suck at design.
- user interface is fluid and visually appealing exceeds expectations

## Maintainability/Code Quality
- theres some issues of separation of concerns here
- small issues with code indentation
- you guys are doing entirely too much logic in your views, the most logic you should ever do is an each method and *maybe* a conditional
- other than that looks good, and meets expectations

## Evidence of Comprehension
- awesome job guys, I really like that you guys decided to not only incorporate 1 api but TWO apis! kudos
- In addition to that you incorporated user auth, although you didn't do anything with user authentication, you still have it! Maybe you could add a favoriting functionality
- I think you guys exceed expectations for this category. Except no TDD! eitherway, exceeds expectations, nice job guys.
